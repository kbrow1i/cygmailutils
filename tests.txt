x86
===

Same except for mail tests, where 20 failed and 1 was unresolved.

Reason for failed mail tests on x86: Some of the tests in folder.exp
rely on the "current mailbox", which is the value of the environment
variable MBOX.  If this isn't set, it defaults to ~/mbox.  It's
supposed to be set by the line

  set env(MBOX) "$MU_SPOOL_DIR/mbox"

in mail/testsuite/lib/mail.exp, but for some reason this doesn't work
on x86.  If I export

  MBOX=/home/kbrown/src/cygmailutils/mailutils-3.3-1.i686/build/mail/testsuite/data/spool/mbox

before running the tests, then the ones in folder.exp pass.  I still
get failures in read.exp and z.exp that I haven't tracked down, but
I'll bet it's something similar.

Reason for maidag failures: No root user.  I don't know if maidag is
usable.

Reason for sieve failure: Illegal filename character?

Reason for mail/tests failure: One character mismatch.
